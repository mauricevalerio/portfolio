## Portfolio

My Single Page Application (SPA) personal portfolio. Built with HTML, CSS, and React.

## Reflection
Built a personal portfolio to demonstrate the knowledge I've learned over the past months on Scrimba's Frontend Developer Career Path and to showcase my projects.

My challenges were to establish my own color scheme, personalized logos, and integrating Netlify with Google Domains.

Used Vite for bundling the code and also used different tools from npm including the latest `React Burger Menu`, `React Animation on Scroll`, and `EmailJS`. Used FontAwesome for some of the logos.

I've also integrated it to Google Analytics and made some SEOs.
